# Welcome to Login System
This is the simplest login system that will signup a user, log them in, and log
the out. This simple login system uses php, html, css, and sql. The CSS styling
is trash (--I admit), but I only did just enough CSS to have the site not look
trash. My primary goal for this project is not to make it look pretty, but to
practice the php and sql 'thinking' that makes this login system complete.
These would include understanding sessions, forms, post request, get request,
post redirect, and flash messages.

## php
This login system is written php 7.4.

## Database Tools
This login script is database backed. As such, PDO and prepared sql statements
are used to optimize security. Unique index and primary keys are used to
optimize query speed.

Note: This login script use PostgreSQL DBMS.

### Side Notes
What in the world is 'Hack' programming language? Github says there's 3.5% Hack
in my project. ??????!!!!
